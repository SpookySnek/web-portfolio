        <h2>üë±üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Who am I?</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Carl, I am a curious and friendly developer from Sweden. I graduated from the Full Stack .NET program in School of Applied Technology back in april 2022, and has since been working as a developer. Before that I had about 4 years worth of practical experience from private full stack projects.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have a good understanding of and master many different technologies such as:
          C#/.NET, React, JavaScript, TypeScript, Entity Framework Core, .NET Web API, Docker, Azure cloud services, Agile Scrum, TDD, mob-programing, back end, front end, etc. Take a peek at my projects down below and you'll see many more technologies! For example this website is made in Vite.js and Three.js. It looks pretty cool, right?
        </p>

        <p>
          I am not afraid of trying new technologies. Producing clean code that is easy to maintain is my goal. Despite my relatively short time as a professional developer, I have demonstrably succeeded in building up my skills quickly and I see it as proof of the curious and fast learning person I am, and I have also learned through my time with mob programming the importance of cooperation.

          <h2>üë®üèª‚Äçüíª Projects</h2>
          <h4>This is a little collection of some of my favourite projects!</h4>
          <h3>Calle's Super Mega RPG</h3>
          <p>
              Calle's Super Mega RPG is a hobby project that I've been working on when I have time over. It is a RPG game engine made in C#, with WPF as the view currently. This project is a way for me to deepen my knowledge in C#/.NET, by implementing several different techniques and patterns often seen in production. I plan on porting it over to .NET MAUI in the future, and I might even try porting it to Unity. <br> <a href="https://github.com/SpookySnek/calles-super-mega-rpg">Link</a>
          </p>
          <h3>Internal Recruitment Platform</h3>
          <p>
              At iceberry (see Work History below) I was tasked with starting up a new internal recruitment platform from scratch together with another colleague. We built the platform in mainly .NET (C#) utilizing a microservice architecture with Kubernetes, and used React with Redux on the front end. We automized the build using GitHub Actions, Docker, Docker Compose etc. During this project I took a deep dive into the world of microservices and Kubernetes deployment for the first time, and it was a very educative experience!
          </p>
          <h3>.NET MAUI Sample App</h3>
          <p>
              In this project I experiment with different tools and functions in MAUI to further develop my competence, that I can later use to create more apps privately. The app is being developed with different functionalities to try out everything MAUI has to offer and works on iOS, Android, Windows, etc. <br> <a href="https://github.com/SpookySnek/SampleApp">Link</a>
          </p>
          <h3>Propono</h3>
          <p>
              Propono is a single-day and one-man fullstack-project for the School of Applied Technology, a website where users can add images that are then displayed back in a nice way. The website is complete with backend in ASP.NET Core Web API and uses Entity Framework Core for database management, together with Docker locally, with React (TypeScript) on the front end side. Mobile-First of course! <br> <a href="https://github.com/SpookySnek/Propono">Link</a>
          </p>
          <h3>Mob Timer</h3>
          <p>
              This is my group's final project at the School of Applied Technology, that we developed in an agile enviroment using SCRUM and mob-programing principles. We chose to make a "mob timer" that is updated in real-time using websockets, and where you can start your own group and distribute a personal link to others who thus can join your group. The front end part is made in react (TypeScript) and for the backend, we used ASP.NET Core Web API in symbiosis with Entity Framework Core and Docker locally, and then deployed on Vercel. When it comes to websockets, we used SignalR for the first time. <br> <a href="https://github.com/Jam-Net-SALT/Saltimer-BE">Link backend</a> &nbsp; <a href="https://github.com/Jam-Net-SALT/Saltimer-FE">Link frontend</a>
          </p>
          <h3>Web Portfolio</h3>
          <p>
              This is my personal portfolio website that I made to show off my skills and projects. It is made using JavaScript in Vite.js and Three.js. Both Vite and Three are very new to me and are meant to show off my ability to tackle new challanges and technologies! <br> <a href="https://github.com/SpookySnek/web-portfolio">Link</a>
              <h3>Peritus</h3>
          <p>
              Peritus is a fullstack project where users can upload quotes, made with ASP.NET Core Minimal API (.NET 6) with Entity Framework Core for database management in the back end, and React with Typescript for the front end. <br> <a href="https://github.com/SpookySnek/Peritus-BE">Link backend</a> &nbsp; <a href="https://github.com/SpookySnek/Peritus-FE">Link frontend</a>

          <h3>Java Game Prototype</h3>
          <p>
              At the age of 14, a group of friends and I decided to learn Java and make an MMO game in jMonkeyEngine. We spent many weekends together and finally managed to put together a simple prototype. The knowledge we gained from this project has been invaluable in my quest to become a developer.
          </p>
          <h3>LUA Code for roblox</h3>
          <p>
              At the age of 8, I wrote my very first piece of code, for the game Roblox. I learned very simple concepts in programming and often succeeded in what I wanted to do by programming in simple text editors. This is where my dream of one day becoming a real developer started!
