        <h2>üë±üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Who am I?</h2>
        <p>
          I am a Full Stack Developer from Sweden that has graduated from School of Applied Technology year 2022 with results close to senior-level. Before that I had about 4 years worth of practical experience from private fullstack-projects.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have a good understanding of and master many different technologies such as:
          C#/.NET, React, Javascript, Typescript, Entity Framework Core, .NET Web API, Docker, Azure cloud services, Agile Scrum, TDD, mob-programing, backend, frontend, etc. Take a peek at my projects down below and you'll see many more technologies! For example this website is made in Vite.js and Three.js. It looks pretty cool, right?
        </p>

        <p>
          I am not afraid of trying new technologies. Producing clean code that is easy to maintain is my goal. Despite my relatively short time as a professional developer, I have demonstrably succeeded in building up my skills quickly and I see it as proof of the curious and fast-learning person I am and I have also learned through my time with mob programming the importance of cooperation and really appreciate it.

        <h2>üë®üèª‚Äçüíª Projects</h2>
        <h4>This is a little collection of some of my favourite projects, outside of my current projects as a consultant (iceberry)!</h4>
        <h3>.NET MAUI Sample App</h3>
        <p>
          In this project I experiment with different tools and functions in MAUI to further develop my competence, that I can later use to create more apps privately. The app is being developed with different functionalities to try out everything MAUI has to offer and works on iOS, Android, Windows, etc. <br> <a href="https://github.com/SpookySnek/SampleApp">Link</a>
        </p>
        <h3>Propono</h3>
        <p>
          Propono is a single-day and one-man fullstack-project for the School of Applied Technology, a website where users can add images that are then displayed back in a nice way. The website is complete with backend in ASP.NET Core Web API and uses Entity Framework Core for database management, together with Docker locally, with React (TypeScript) on the front end side. Mobile-First of course! <br> <a href="https://github.com/SpookySnek/Propono">Link</a>
        </p>
        <h3>Mob Timer</h3>
        <p>
          This is my group's final project at the School of Applied Technology, that we developed in an agile enviroment using SCRUM and mob-programing principles. We chose to make a "mob timer" that is updated in real-time using websockets, and where you can start your own group and distribute a personal link to others who thus can join your group. The front end part is made in react (TypeScript) and for the backend, we used ASP.NET Core Web API in symbiosis with Entity Framework Core and Docker locally, and then deployed on Vercel. When it comes to websockets, we used SignalR for the first time. <br> <a href="https://github.com/Jam-Net-SALT/Saltimer-BE">Link backend</a> <a href="https://github.com/Jam-Net-SALT/Saltimer-FE">Link frontend</a>

        <h3>Web Portfolio</h3>
        <p>
          This is my personal portfolio website that I made to show off my skills and projects. It is made using JavaScript in Vite.js and Three.js. Both Vite and Three are very new to me and are meant to show off my ability to adapt to new challanges! <br> <a href="https://github.com/SpookySnek/web-portfolio">Link</a>
        <h3>Peritus</h3>
        <p>
          Peritus is a fullstack project where users can upload quotes, made with ASP.NET Core Minimal API (.NET 6) with Entity Framework Core for database management in the backend, and React with Typescript for the frontend. <br> <a href="https://github.com/SpookySnek/Peritus-BE">Link backend</a> <a href="https://github.com/SpookySnek/Peritus-FE">Link frontend</a>

        <h3>Java Game Prototype</h3>
        <p>
          At the age of 14, a group of friends and I decided to learn Java and make an MMO game in jMonkeyEngine. We spent many weekends together and finally managed to put together a simple prototype. The knowledge we gained from this project has been invaluable in my quest to become a developer.
        </p>
        <h3>LUA Code for roblox</h3>
        <p>
          At the age of 8, I wrote my very first piece of code, for the game Roblox. I learned very simple concepts in programming and often succeeded in what I wanted to do by programming in simple text editors. This is where my dream of one day becoming a real developer started!
